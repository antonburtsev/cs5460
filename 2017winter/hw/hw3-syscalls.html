<h1>HW3: xv6 system calls</h1>

<p>In this homework you will modify xv6 to add a system call.  You can use the same setup as for
  the <a href="hw2-boot-xv6.html">HW2: Xv6 boot</a>.
  
<h2>Part One: System call tracing</h2>

<p>Your first task is to modify the xv6 kernel to print out a line for
each system call invocation. It is enough to print the name of the
system call and the return value; you don't need to print the system
call arguments.

<p>
When you're done, you should see output like this when booting
xv6:

<pre>
...
fork -> 2
exec -> 0
open -> 3
close -> 0
$write -> 1
 write -> 1
</pre>

<p>
That's init forking and execing sh, sh making sure only two file descriptors are
open, and sh writing the $ prompt.  (Note: the output of the shell and the
system call trace are intermixed, because the shell uses the write syscall to
print its output.)

<p>
  Hint: modify the syscall() function in syscall.c.
  

<p>
<b>Challenge (10% extra)</b>: print the system call arguments.

<h2>Part Two: ps system call</h2>

<p>
Your second task is to add a new system call to xv6. The main point of the
exercise is for you to see some of the different pieces of the system call
machinery.

<p>
Your new system call will get information about the processes running in the 
system and return it to the user program. Specifically, your new system call 
will have the following interface:
<pre>
int getprocinfo(int pid, struct uproc *up);
</pre>
Where pid is the process id of the target process, and struct uproc is a
structure that describes the process, i.e., contains the following information
about the process: process name, process id, parent process id, size of process
memory, process state, whether process is waiting on a channel, and whether
it's been killed. 

<p>
You will have to define the <tt>struct uproc</tt> and implement the ps utility
by querying the system about all processes in the system.  
You should create a user-level program that calls your <tt>getprocinfo</tt> system
call; here's some source you should put in <tt>ps.c</tt>:

<pre>
#include "types.h"
#include "user.h"

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

  // your code to print the process information in any format you like...

  exit();
}
</pre>

<p>
In order to make your new <tt>ps</tt> program available to run from
the xv6 shell, add <tt>_ps</tt> to the <tt>UPROGS</tt> definition
in <tt>Makefile</tt>.

<p>
Since both the kernel and user level code need the definition of the <tt>struct uproc</tt> structure, 
we can define in one of the header files visible at both levels. For example lets put it in <tt>"stat.h"</tt>
<pre>
struct uproc {
    // your code to define pid, ppid, sz 
};
</pre>



<p> Your strategy for making the <tt>getprocinfo</tt> system call should be to clone all of the
pieces of code that are specific to some existing system call, for example the
"uptime" system call. You should grep for uptime in all the source files, using
<tt>grep -n uptime *.[chS]</tt>.

<p>
To define <tt>struct uproc</tt> look at how the same fields are defined in
xv6's <tt>struct proc</tt>.

<p>
When you're done, typing <tt>ps</tt> to an xv6 shell prompt
should print all processes running in the system and information about them. 

<p>
In the HW3.txt file write down a few words of explanation for each of the 
files you had to modify in the process of creating your <tt>getprocinfo()</tt> system call.

<h2>Part 3: ptable locks</h2>

<p>
<b>Question 1:</b>Did you forget to acquire the process table <tt>ptable.lock</tt>? 

<p>
<b>Question 2:</b>Explain how <tt>ptable.lock</tt> lock is used in xv6. Search
through the source code and find all uses of  <tt>ptable.lock</tt>. Most of
them are straightforward, one interesting case is the use of
<tt>ptable.lock</tt> is how it is used across context switch (to understand
this case, read Section "Code: Scheduling" from Chapter 5 of the <a
href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6/book-rev9.pdf">xv6 book</a>.

<div class="question"> <p><b>Submit</b> <p>Submit your answers to the <a
href="https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/dropbox/index.php?op=openfolder&folder=493160&quarter=W17">Class
Dropbox (143A HW 3: System calls)</a> as a compressed tar file of your xv6
source tree, and as a separate PDF file with answers for Part 3. You can use
the following command to create a compressed tar file
<pre>
vagrant@odin$ cd /vagrant/ics143a
vagrant@odin$ tar -czvf hw3.tgz xv6-public
