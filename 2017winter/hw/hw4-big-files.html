<h1>Homework 4: Bigger files for xv6</h1>

<p>In this assignment you'll increase the maximum size of an
xv6 file. Currently xv6 files are limited to 140 sectors, or 71,680
bytes. This limit comes from the fact that an xv6 inode contains 12
"direct" block numbers and one "singly-indirect" block number, which
refers to a block that holds up to 128 more block numbers, for a total
of 12+128=140. You'll change the xv6 file system code to support
a "triply-indirect" block in each inode, containing
128 addresses of doubly-indirect blocks, each of which
can contain up to 16384 addresses of data blocks. 


<div class="design"> <p><span class="header"><b>Question 1</b></span><br>Using
the triple indirect system what is the maximum number of blocks one inode can
address?  <br> This corresponds to how many bytes on disk?  </div> 

<p> <div class="design"> <p><span class="header"><b>Question 2</b></span><br>
<br> If we were to implement a doubly-indirect system instead of a
triple-indirect system what would be the maximum number of blocks one inode
could address?  <br> This corresponds to how many bytes on disk?  </div>


</p><h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<p>Modify your Makefile's <tt>CPUS</tt> definition so that it reads:
</p>
<pre>
CPUS := 1
</pre>

<p>And add <tt>-snapshot</tt> to the definition of <tt>QEMUOPTS</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
QEMUOPTS = -drive file=fs.img,index=1,media=disk,format=raw -drive file=xv6.img,index=0,media=disk,format=raw -smp $(CPUS) -m 512 $(QEMUEXTRA) -snapshot
</pre>

<p>
The above two steps speed up qemu tremendously when xv6
creates large files.

</p><p><tt>mkfs</tt> initializes the file system to have fewer
than 1000 free data blocks, too few to show off the changes
you'll make. Modify the code at the start of <tt>param.h</tt> to 
read (thats 128*128*128 blocks or 1GB)
</p><pre>
#define FSSIZE       2097152
</pre>

<p>You don't really need 1GB since we only be writing 160MB of data, so you can play with this number if generating a file system take too long.

<b> Note: <br>
During make mkfs.c has to build a 1GB File system. This takes some time, sometimes up to a minute depening on the machine, be patient.
<br></b>


<p>Download <a href="big.c">big.c</a> into
your xv6 directory, add them to the UPROGS list (same as you did for ps), start
up xv6, and run <tt>big</tt>. It writes 4 files: 16MB, 32MB, 48MB, and 64MB,
and then reads them --- this will help you to test your solution. Big writes
1mb at a time, which is significantly faster (and yet it takes quite a bit of
time). 

</p><h2>What to Look At</h2>

The format of an on-disk inode is defined by <tt>struct dinode</tt>
in <tt>fs.h</tt>. You're particularly interested in <tt>NDIRECT</tt>,
<tt>NINDIRECT</tt>, <tt>MAXFILE</tt>, and the <tt>addrs[]</tt>
element of <tt>struct dinode</tt>. Look 
<a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/homework/inode.pdf">here</a> for a diagram of the standard xv6 inode.

<p><b>Note</b><br>
Since you're using a triple indirect systemyou will have to add more defines to fs.h.

<p>
The code that finds a file's data on disk is in <tt>bmap()</tt>
in <tt>fs.c</tt>. Have a look at it and make sure you understand
what it's doing. <tt>bmap()</tt> is called both when reading and
writing a file. When writing, <tt>bmap()</tt> allocates new
blocks as needed to hold file content, as well as allocating
an indirect block if needed to hold block addresses.

</p><p>
<tt>bmap()</tt> deals with two kinds of block numbers. The <tt>bn</tt>
argument is a "logical block" -- a block number relative to the start
of the file. The block numbers in <tt>ip-&gt;addrs[]</tt>, and the
argument to <tt>bread()</tt>, are disk block numbers.
You can view <tt>bmap()</tt> as mapping a file's logical
block numbers into disk block numbers.

<h2>Your Job</h2>

Modify bmap() so that it implements a triple-indirect system. The first 12 elements of ip->addrs[] should be direct blocks; the 13th should be a triple-indirect block system.

<p>
One thing to remember is each entry with a ... points to a table as well, I just couldn't make the graph in ascii like that.
<br>
Another way to think about it is a 3D array <tt>table[128][128][128]</tt>.


<p>
After you have modified <tt>bmap()</tt> you need to go into 
<tt>mkfs.c</tt> and modify <tt>iappend()</tt>. This c file
gets run during the make process and builds the file system
image which gets run with QEMU. The code and logic will be 
extremely similar to the code you had written in bmap().

<p>
You will have to implement these changes, these changes allow for you to write large files into the xv6 filesystem.


<p>
You don't have to modify xv6 to handle deletion of files with
triple-indirect blocks.


<h2>Hints</h2>

<p>
Make sure you understand <tt>bmap()</tt>. Write out a diagram of the
relationships between <tt>ip-&gt;addrs[]</tt>, the direct blocks, the
triple-indirect blocks. Make sure you understand why adding a triple-indirect
block increases the maximum file size by such a large factor.

</p><p>
Think about how you'll index the triple-indirect block, and
the double blocks and single blocks it points to, with the logical block
number.

</p><p>If your file system gets into a bad state, perhaps
by crashing, you may need to
delete <tt>fs.img</tt> (do this from Unix, not xv6).

</p><p>Don't forget to <tt>brelse()</tt> each block that you
<tt>bread()</tt>.

</p><p>You should allocate indirect blocks and doubly-indirect
blocks only as needed, like the original <tt>bmap()</tt>.

<p>The TA's solution was done in around 70 lines of code

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header"><b>Extra Credit 1 (10%)</b></span><br>
Writing a 1gb file to disk in xv6 is incredibly slow. It gets slower the fuller the disk gets(hint). There are two ways to speed up writing a file to disk.
In extra_credit.txt explain why when the disk gets fuller writing gets slower-- Explain how you can mitigate this problem. Second, explain the other way to speed up writes and why that works (hint log.c).
</div>

<div class="challenge">
<p><span class="header"><b>Extra Credit 2 (20%)</b></span><br>
Implement these changes, in xv6, resolving all panics and failed assertions that arise. Do a crappy timing experiment using a stop watch. Explain how much speed up occured.
