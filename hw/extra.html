<h1>Extra credit assignments</h1> 

<p> 
Here are some options for extra credit assignments you can try. Each assignment
has a percentage next to it. If you successfully finish the assignment this
percentage is added to your total grade for the class. 

<p> Note, you will have to pass the assignment in person.  We will interview
you asking to explain your solution and how you arrived to it.  We will also
rigorously check for plagiarism. If you intend to accomplish more than 22%
worth of extra credit, let us know, we might want to talk to you (again to
prevent plagiarism). 
 
<h3>Top tool for xv6 (+7%)</h3> 

Implement top for xv6. The  top  program  provides a list of running processes
and how much time each process spends on the CPU. While in a real UNIX system
top provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system, in this assignment
it is sufficient to implement top in such a way that it outputs a sorted (by
CPU time) list of processes in the system and exits. Note, however, that you
should extend xv6 with the ability to track how much time each process spends
on the CPU. Make sure you develop meaningful applications, e.g., something that
takes 25% of the CPU, 50% of the CPU, etc., to convince us that your top
returns faithful CPU utilization numbers. 

<!--

<h3>Posix-like threads (+5%)</h3>

Right now xv6 does not support threads. This assignment asks you to extend xv6
with the Posix threads interface. Threads are very much like processes, however
they share the same address space. For example to create a thread a process can
call

<pre> int pthread_create(void (*start_routine) ());</pre>

Where <tt>start_routine</tt> is a pointer to the function where the new thread
starts execution, and return value is the ID of the new thread. 

<p> Similar, 

<pre>void pthread_exit();</pre>

allows the thread to exit. 

<p>And

<pre>pthread_yield()</pre> 

allows the thread to yield the CPU to another thread, or process.  -->

<h3>One page per process (+15%)</h3>

Remember, that one midterm question asked you to analyze how many pages are
allocated every time xv6 creates a new process. This assignment asks you to
reduce the number of pages to one. You can assume that process text and data
sections fit in one 4KB page. 

You will have to analyze how xv6 uses pages when each process is created and
come up with ways to eliminate it. E.g., a single kernel stack page can be
shared among multiple processes (you only need one kernel stack page per-CPU to
avoid race conditions between interrupts and exceptions on different CPUs).
Similar the page table can be shared among all processes. 


<h3>3GB user memory (+7%)</h3>

Since we now know that xv6 can't provide user-processes with more than 2GBs of
memory, this assignment asks you to fix this. Change both the address at which
the kernel is mapped from 2GB to 3 GB (like you did in HW3), and change the
memory manager to provide support for 3GB of ram. 

<h3>xv6 without page tables (+7%)</h3>

Implement xv6 without using page tables. Instead use segments. You need to
ensure process isolation, allocate process memory dynamically, i.e., grow the
segment and maybe even relocate it in physical memory if it runs out of memory
and starts overlapping with another segment.
