<h1>Homework 1: OS interface and shell</h1>

<p>This assignment will make you more familiar with the Unix system call
interface and the shell by implementing several simple programs and several
features in a small shell, which we will refer to as the 143A shell.  You can
do this assignment on any operating system that supports the Unix API (Linux
andromeda-XX.ics.uci.edu machines, your laptop that runs Linux or Linux VM, and
even MacOS, etc.).  Submit your programs and the shell through Canvas (see instructions at
the bottom of this page). 

<p>First, you have to read the Chapter 0 of the <a
href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6/book-rev9.pdf">xv6 book</a>.

<h2>Part 1: Simple UNIX programs</h2> 

<p>Download the <a href="main.c">main.c</a>, and look it over. This is a
skeleton for a simple UNIX program.  

<p>To compile <tt>main.c</tt>, you need a C compiler, such as gcc.  On
andromeda-XX.ics.uci.edu (Openlab machines), you can compile the skeleton as
follows: <pre> $ gcc main.c </pre> which produces an <tt>a.out</tt> file, which
you can run: <pre> $ ./a.out </pre> 

<p>Alternatively you can pass an additional option to gcc to give a more
meaningful name to the compiled binary, like <pre> $gcc sh.c -o foobar143a
</pre>

<p>Here gcc will compile your program as <tt>foobar143A</tt>.  

In the rest of this part of the assignment you will convert <tt>main.c</tt>
into several simple UNIX programs. 

<h3>File copy command (cp143a)</h3>

<p>Use the main.c template as a starting point for a simple file copy command
that you should implement. First copy the <tt>main.c</tt> into
<tt>main-cp143a.c</tt> (you will need to use <tt>main.c</tt> for other programs
later, so lets keep it around). 

<p>The file copy command should take two arguments: names of the input and the
output files and copy the input file into the output file.  Here is an example
invocation which copies <tt>main.c</tt> into <tt>main-out.c</tt> (assuming you
call your executable <tt>cp143a</tt>).  

<pre>cp143a main.c main-out.c</pre>

You should use <tt>read()</tt> and <tt>write()</tt> system calls to read the
input file and write the output. Since <tt>cp143a</tt> takes command line
arguments you should change the definition of the <tt>main()</tt> function to
allow passing of command line arguements like:

<pre>int main(int argc, char *argv[])</pre>

If you have never worked with command line arguments in C here is a link that
might be useful: <a
href="http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/chapter10/arguments_to_main.html">Arguments
to main</a>. You can also take a look at a couple of user-level programs that take 
command line arguments from the xv6 source tree: <a
href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/master/rm.c">rm.c</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/master/ls.c">ls.c</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/master/wc.c">wc.c</a>.

<p><b>Note:</b> You might find it useful to look at the manual page for
<tt>read()</tt>, <tt>write()</tt>, and other system calls. For example, type
<pre> $man read </pre> and read about the <tt>read</tt> system call. Here the
manual says that you should include <pre>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;</pre> in your
program to be able to use it, and the system call can be called as a function
with the following signature 

<pre> ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count); </pre>

The manual describes the meaning of the arguments for the system call, return
value, and possible return codes. Finally, it lists several related system
calls that might be helpful. 

<p>Note that when the manual list a function like <tt>open(2)</tt> it means
that it's described in the 2nd section of the manual and to get to the specific
section you have to invoke man with an additional argument like this: 

<pre>man 2 open</pre> 

It's a good idea to read the man entry on man itself, i.e., <pre>man man</pre>.
Some useful commands are <tt>-k</tt> to search the manual for the string
matching a query:

<pre>man -k open</pre>

Note, that here there are multiple entries for the <tt>open()</tt> system call
and default invocation of <pre>man open</pre> will return an entry for the
<tt>openvt</tt> command, and not file open command.
 

<h3>Simple I/O redirection (lsy143a)</h3>

<p>Use the <tt>main.c</tt> template again as a starting point for another
simple program that starts <tt>ls</tt> command but redirects its output into a
<tt>y</tt> file. I.e., your program should do an equivalent of this shell
command

<pre>ls > y</pre>

Internally your program should start <tt>ls</tt>, but before doing this it
should arrange that output of the <tt>ls</tt> is redirected into a file. Note, you don't have to 
implement <tt>ls</tt> itself, just start the one that is already there in the 
system with the <tt>exec()</tt> system call. 

<p>First copy the <tt>main.c</tt> into <tt>main-lsy143a.c</tt> (again you will
need to use <tt>main.c</tt> for other programs later).  

<p>Here is how an example invocation of your program should look 
(assuming you call your executable <tt>lsy143a</tt>).   

<pre>lsy143a</pre>

You should use <pre>exec()</pre> system call to start ls and use other system
calls required to implement redirection, e.g., <tt>close()</tt>,
<tt>open()</tt>. 

<h3>Simple pipes (pipe143a)</h3>

<p>Use the main.c template again as a starting point for another simple program
that starts <tt>ls</tt> command but redirects its output into the <tt>grep
"main"</tt> program, which itself redirects its output to the <tt>wc</tt>.
I.e., your program should internally start three programs connected into with
pipes that produce output equivalent of this shell command

<pre>ls |grep "main" |wc</pre>

Internally your program should start three new programs: <tt>ls</tt>, <tt>grep
"main"</tt>, and <tt>wc</tt> and connect them with pipes. 

<p>Copy the <tt>main.c</tt> into <tt>main-pipe143a.c</tt>. Here is an example
invocation of your program (assuming you call your executable
<tt>pipe143a</tt>).  

<pre>pipe143a</pre>

You should use <tt>exec()</tt> and <tt>fork()</tt> system calls to create
programs, <tt>pipe()</tt> system call to create pipes, and other system calls
required for connecting pipes, e.g., <tt>close()</tt>, <tt>dup()</tt>. 

<h2>Part 2: Building a shell</h2>

Now you are ready to integrate the basic skills that you've gained in the first
part of the assignment into a more general program that implements I/O
redirection, the shell. If you are not familiar with what a shell does, do the
<a
href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/2015/wwwdocs/assignments/handson-unix.html">Unix
hands-on</a> from 6.033 class at MIT (this is optional and will not be graded
in 143A). 

<p>Download the <a href="sh.c">143A shell</a>, and look it
over. The 143A shell contains two main parts: parsing shell commands and
implementing them. The parser recognizes only simple shell commands such as the
following:

<pre>
ls > y
cat < y | sort | uniq | wc > y1
cat y1
rm y1
ls |  sort | uniq | wc
rm y
</pre>
Cut and paste these commands into a file <tt>t.sh</tt>

<p>To compile <tt>sh.c</tt>, you need a C compiler, such as gcc.  On andromeda-XX.ics.uci.edu (Openlab machines), you
can compile the skeleton shell as follows:
<pre>
$ gcc sh.c
</pre>
which produces an <tt>a.out</tt> file, which you can run:
<pre>
$ ./a.out < t.sh
</pre>
This execution will print error messages because you have not implemented several features. In
the rest of this assignment you will implement those features.

<p>Alternatively you can pass an additional option to gcc to give a more meaningful name to the compiled binary, like
<pre>
$gcc sh.c -o sh143A
</pre>

<p>Here gcc will compile your shell as <tt>sh143A</tt>. 

<p> The output of <tt>ls</tt> executed on shell may differ from the one executed inside the script. This is because <tt>ls</tt> is usally aliased to include some options on most shells.
<pre>
alias ls='ls -F --color=auto --human-readable --almost-all'
</pre>
<p> Especially, <tt>-F</tt> option appends * to the executable file names, adding a few bytes to the <tt>wc</tt>'s input. In order to make outputs consistent, run the following command on shell.
<pre>
$ unalias ls
</pre>
<p> You can restore the <tt>ls</tt> alias with the following command.
<pre>
$ source ~/.bashrc
</pre>

<h2>Executing simple commands</h2>

<p>Now, you're ready to work on the homework itself. First, extend your shell to implement simple commands, such as executing external programs, for example ls:
<pre>
$ ls
</pre>

<p>Here you tell the shell to execute ls.

<p>In the sh.c, the parser already builds an <tt>execcmd</tt> for you, so the only code you
have to write is for the ' ' case in <tt>runcmd</tt>. <b>At a high level you should understand a 
typical UNIX interface that we've discussed in class (the functions to cone processes, i.e., 
fork(), executing new processes, i.e., exec(), working with file descriptors (close(), dup(), open(), wait(), etc.). 
Combine these functions to implement various shell features.</b>  



<p>
You might find it useful
to look at the manual page for exec, for example, type
<pre>
$man 3 exec
</pre>
and read about <tt>execv</tt>. Print an error message when exec fails.

<p>To test your program, compile and run the resulting a.out:
<pre>
$./a.out
</pre>

This prints a prompt and waits for input. <tt>sh.c</tt> prints as prompt
<tt>143A$</tt> so that you don't get confused with your computer's shell.

Now type the following in your shell:
<pre>
143A$ ls
</pre>

<p>Your shell may print an error message (unless there is a program named
<tt>ls</tt> in your working directory or you are using a version
of <tt>exec</tt> that searches <tt>PATH</tt>, i.e., execlp(), execvp(), or execvpe()).  

Now type the following:

<pre>
143A$ /bin/ls
</pre>

<p>This should execute the program <tt>/bin/ls</tt>, which should print out the
file names in your working directory. You can stop the 143A shell by typing
ctrl-d, which should put you back in your computer's shell.

<p>You may want to change the 143A shell to always try <tt>/bin</tt>, if the program
doesn't exist in the current working directory, so that below you don't have to
type "/bin" for each program, or (which is better) use one of the exec functions 
that search the <tt>PATH</tt> variable. 

<h2>I/O redirection</h2>

<p>Implement I/O redirection commands so that you can run:
<pre>echo "143A is cool" > x.txt
cat < x.txt
</pre>

<p>The parser already recognizes ">" and "<", and builds a <tt>redircmd</tt> for
you, so your job is just filling out the missing code in <tt>runcmd</tt> for
those symbols. You might find the man pages for open and close useful.

<p>Note that the <tt>mode</tt> field in <tt>redircmd</tt> contains access modes
  (e.g., <tt>O_RDONLY</tt>), which you should pass in the <tt>flags</tt>
  argument to <tt>open</tt>; see <tt>parseredirs</tt> for the mode values that
  the shell is using and the manual page for <tt>open</tt> for
  the <tt>flags</tt> argument.

<p>Make sure you print an error message if one of the system calls you are using fails.

<p>Make sure your implementation runs correctly with the above test input.  A
common error is to forget to specify the permission with which the file must be
created (i.e., the 3rd argument to open).

<h2>Implement pipes</h2>

<p>Implement pipes so that you can run command pipelines such as:
<pre>
$ ls | sort | uniq | wc
</pre>

<p>The parser already recognizes "|", and builds a <tt>pipecmd</tt> for you, so
the only code you must write is for the '|' case in <tt>runcmd</tt>.  You might
find the man pages for pipe, fork, close, and dup useful.

<p>Test that you can run the above pipeline. The <tt>sort</tt> program may be in
the directory <tt>/usr/bin/</tt> and in that case you can type the absolute
pathname <tt>/usr/bin/sort</tt> to run sort.  (In your computer's shell you can
type <tt>which sort</tt> to find out which directory in the shell's search path
has an executable named "sort".)

<p>From one of the andromeda machines you should be able to run the following 
command correctly (here a.out is your 143A shell):
<pre>
$ a.out < t.sh
</pre>


<p>Don't forget to submit your solution through 
Canvas <a href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/12602">Canvas HW1 OS Interface and Shell</a>
(as a collection of source files "main-cp143a.c", "main-lsy143a.c", "main-pipe143a.c", and "sh.c"). If you decide to submit a challenge exercise submit an 
extra file "sh-extra.c", and a shell script "extra.sh" that contains an example 
extra command that your shell can handle as a single tar or zip archive. 
Please write us a comment at the top of 
"sh-extra.c" explaining  which extra features you decided to handle. 

<h2>Challenge exercises (extra 21%, 7% each)</h2>

<p>You can add <b>any</b> feature of your choice to your shell.  But, you may want to consider
the following as a start:
<ul>
<li> Implement lists of commands, separated by ";"
<li> Implement sub shells by implementing "(" and ")"
<li> Implement running commands in the background by supporting "&" and "wait"
</ul>
All of these require making changes to the parser and the <tt>runcmd</tt>
function.
